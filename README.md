# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by using a multiple-line graph that shows weekly fares for each city type, to be used by PyBer to make decisions.

## Results

In this analysis i found results for three different city types, those being rural, suburban, and urban. Within the three city types i found each types total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride, and average fare per driver. All of which can been seen in the image below.

### Total Rides

In total rides rural came in last place, suburban 2nd, and urban 1st. Which makes sense because rural areas have the smallest population, suburban having a greater population then rural, and urban having the biggest population out of all three types. The bigger the population the more rides that will be given.

### Total Drivers

Same story here as total rides, rural in 3rd, suburban 2nd, and urban 1st. With the same argument that the higher the population the more drivers that will be needed.

### Total Fares

Yet again rural in 3rd, suburban 2nd, and urban in 1st. Which still makes sense because the more rides given equals the more fares that can be collected.

### Average Fares per Ride

Here is where things get alittle more interesting, this time rural is in 1st, suburban in 2nd, and urban in 3rd. This could be due to population again. Since rural areas are less populated and have fewer drivers and fewer total rides the fare could be higher to compensate. As well as urban areas having more rides and drivers, that allows them to charge less for the fares.

### Average Fare per Driver

The numbers here also follow the average fares per ride trend with rural coming in 1st, suburban in 2nd, and urban in 3rd. Which makes sense with the argument that rural being less populated and harder to find either customers, a ride, or a driver they can charge more for the fare. Where urban being highly populated with an abundance of customers, rides, and drivers being able to charge less per fare.

## Summary

### Rural

Ride-sharing in rural areas have the highest fare cost per driver and per ride, but yield by far the smallest amount of total fares. Making four times less money then suburban and almost ten times less money then urban. Therefore i would not recomend having a ride-share company in rural areas.

### Suburban

Suburban areas have a nice middle ground coming out in 2nd place in every category analysed. Therefore they are a safe bet to make middle of the road money in but still made only half as much as urban areas in total fares. Having a ride-sharing company in suburban areas would be a safe bet to make some middle of the road money but doesnt carry the potential to make lot of money.

### Urban

The clear winner for a place to have a ride-sharing company is urban areas. Total fares is the most important category in this analysis because it corallates to how much money was made and urban areas by far made more money the rural or suburban areas. The high population creates high demand and the higher the demand the more money there is to be made. As you can see in the image below urban areas in a five month period make the most in total fares for all five months by far.
